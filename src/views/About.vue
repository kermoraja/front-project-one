    <h1>Private Tour Operator of City & Shore Excursions around the Baltic Sea</h1>
    <h3>Viru Tours is dedicated to introducing you to the best of glorious and dynamic culture at  Baltic Sea ports/ cities of Tallinn, Helsinki, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Gdansk, Amsterdam, Brugge, Rotterdam, Riga and Vilnius.</h3>
    <h3>We aim to offer inspirational private city tours and shore excursions allowing our guests to discover the beauty, charm and unique character of each individual destination.</h3>
    <h3>We simply run on the concept, that we have every ability to provide you with the best possible tour experience when the right group of people is paired with the right private guide maximizing your travel potential.</h3>
    <h3>Our secondary mission is also to popularize the guiding as a profession. Many social and technological trends seem to lessen the immeasurable value of a human connection and the beauty of skillful story-telling, thus reduce the value of a live tour guide.</h3>
    <h3>We hope to bring it to honor in the eyes of contemporary travelers, as no travel book, DIY stroll or a tour bus ride can give you the equivalent dynamic and personal experience through the pleasure of sharing stories and views on local life while expanding your world in a more unique and fulfilling way.</h3>
